# Features

* React-Native
* Redux
* Firebase
* Github

# Configuration file (./config.js)

We created the configuration file in order to have easily accessible constants. More importantly, if the colors need to be changed, or fonts need to be changed, they can be changed in one place. Furthermore, we added buttonStyle in order to have UI consistency across our platform(s). We also added config/iconType. This file has all of the icons that we need all across our application.
